# CsvLoader

Created for study purposes in order to consolidate knowledge about database operations with Java. Three projects were created to deal with this role, the first was 
```JdbcCsvLoader```.

## JdbcCsvLoader

This first project created is used as a desktop application that manages and runs a specific store and product database routine, 
being able to register a new store, a new product, price the product in each store and manage the quantity of that same item.
